As discussed today, our outlook factors in our expectation for soft global market conditions and the competitive environment to persist in many of our region outside the US during 2019. Specifically, we now expect that the softer-than-expected performance in Australia and Canada as well as in some of our indirect markets will continue for the remainder of the year.\nAs a reminder, the financial impact of our global growth acceleration plan is included in our outlook for 2019 and is intended to drive additional growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the coming years. In the US, we continue to expect stronger revenue growth in the second half of 2019, as the enhancements that we are making in our North America region will start yielding better results. Based on the cost reduction actions, as well as other initiatives to enhance our production and supply chain operations. Our full year gross margin should be roughly stable year-over-year despite lower expected revenue base. To formulate our outlook, we have used current FX rates and raw material prices change -- changes to FX, all raw material costs may impact our outlook as we move through the year.\nLooking beyond 2019. In May, we introduced our long-term margin goals. We have a range of initiatives in the works under the multi-year global growth acceleration plan. We have a clear path to improve our performance. These plans support our long term gross margin target of 32% to 35% and our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 17% to 18%. The primary drivers for margin improvement are expected to come from: sales growth, particularly in the US, where we expect to benefit from better ASP and product mix; higher capacity utilization of our production facilities; improved efficiencies from our global growth acceleration plan; and finally, introducing innovative products to accelerate growth and improve profitability.\nWe are encouraged that the actions we took in the second quarter have already yielded improvement in our margin and operating leverage. Our team's commitment, along with continued execution of our strategy through the global growth acceleration plan, gave us confidence, as we look forward.\nThank you and we are now ready to open the call for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you.

First question, if I could just try and get a sense when you are able -- reiterating the 2019 EBITDA outlook despite the lowering of sales, which is just obviously pretty encouraging. I was -- would love to get a sense of since a quarter ago, you've had different changes occur in your outlook, obviously you've cited some pluses and some minuses, some -- some tailwinds and some headwinds. When you think about the reiteration of the EBITDA guidance. I'd love to get a sense of obviously, everything kind of offset each other, but -- relative to a quarter ago, if you can kind of give us a -- any type of quantification of what the EBIT, the incremental negative impact on EBITDA was from, some of the headwinds that you've discussed, like the softer sales backdrop, the more competitive backdrop that you're seeing as a result of that in Australia and Canada, maybe even in the US. And then offsetting that, maybe what some of the positives are that you're seeing that allowed you to maintain that full year EBITDA guidance.\nYuval Dagim -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Michael, it's Yuval. Yeah, thanks for the question. I think, putting the growth accelera",
