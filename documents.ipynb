Stat. tit. 20, § 1601 et seg., hereby certifies to\\nthe Oklahoma Supreme Court the following question of law which is determinative of an issue in\\nthe above-entitled case now pending before this Court, and which appears to be unanswered by\\ncontrolling precedent of the Supreme Court or the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma.\\nI. Question of Law\\n\\nMay the Attorney General of Oklahoma, under Title 74, Section 18 of the Oklahoma Stat-\\nutes, “take and assume control” of the “defense of the state’s interests,” Okla. Stat. tit 74 §\\n18b(A)(3), in the instant case before this Court—in which the Governor of Oklahoma is named as\\na defendant in his official capacity for his role in entering into certain tribal-gaming contracts on\\nbehalf of the State of Oklahoma—over the objection of the Governor, who is vested with “Supreme\\nexecutive power” under Article VI, Section 2 of the Oklahoma Constitution, and when the Gover-\\n\\nnor has already exercised his authority under Title 74, Section 6 of the Oklahoma Statutes to “em-\\n\\nploy counsel to protect the rights or interests of the state,” Okla. Stat. tit 74 § 6?\\n\\nCase 1:20-cv-02167-TJK Document 195 Filed 04/08/24 Page 2 of 9\\n\\nII, Factual Background\\n\\nThe instant case before this Court was brought in August 2020 by four Native American\\ntribes who each operate casinos in Oklahoma under a tribal-gaming compact with Oklahoma under\\nthe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (“IGRA”), 25 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. In their operative com-\\nplaint, they seek to have set aside four tribal-gaming compacts for casino operations that four other\\nNative American tribes entered into with Oklahoma that were submitted to the U.S. Secretary of\\nthe Department of the Interior for approval and that were approved through the Secretary’s inaction\\nby operation of law. Plaintiffs allege that the Governor of Oklahoma played a role in violating\\ntheir rights under the IGRA because these compacts were not lawfully entered into by the Governor\\nand violated Oklahoma law in other ways. Since the suit began, the Governor has been represented\\nby retained counsel, whom he represents he hired under Title 74, Section 6 of the Oklahoma Stat-\\nutes, which allows him to “employ counsel to protect the rights or interests of the state.” Okla.\\nStat. tit 74 § 6. And in October 2021, the Governor filed an answer in his official capacity as the\\nGovernor of the State of Oklahoma, with the State of Oklahoma as the real party in interest, in\\nwhich he disputes that any of the compacts at issue are invalid or violate Oklahoma law.\\n\\nIn July 2023, the Attorney General of Oklahoma entered an appearance in the case, claim-\\ning authority under Oklahoma law to “take and assume control” of the “defense of the state’s\\ninterests,” Okla. Stat. tit 74 § 18b(A)(3), because in his view, the compacts at issue were invalid.\\nIn addition, he represented, the Oklahoma Supreme Court has “clearly and unambiguously” held\\nthat the Governor had no authority to unilaterally enter into them, citing Treat v. Stitt, 473 P.3d 43\\n(Okla. 2020); and Treat v. Stitt, 481 P.3d 240 (Okla. 2021). Thus, he argued, the Governor had\\nabrogated his constitutional duty to “cause the laws of the State to be faithfully executed.” Okla.\\n\\nConst. art. VI, § 8. The Governor objected, arguing that the Attorney General does not have the\\n\\nCase 1:20-cv-02167-TJK Document 195 Filed 04/08/24 Page 3 of 9\\n\\nstatutory authority to replace the counsel he had already hired, and even if the Attorney General\\n\\ndid have this statutory authority, doing so would violate the Oklahoma Constitution, which vests\\n\\nthe Governor with “Supreme executive power.” Okla. Const. art. VI, § 2.\\n\\nIll. Acknowledgment of Authority to Reformulate Question\\n\\nPursuant to Oklahoma Statute Title 20, Section 1604(A)(3), the Court acknowledges that\\n\\nthe Oklahoma Supreme Court may reformulate this question presented.\\n\\nIV. Designated Docket Entries\\n\\nThe following docket entries have been designated by the Court, in consultation with the\\n\\nparties, to be sent alongside this Certification Order: ECF Nos. 1, 26, 28, 29, 55, 60, 61, 62, 63,\\n\\n65, 66, 67, 68, 104, 106, 107, 110, 113, 114, 115, 116, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 140,\\n\\n154, 157, 168, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 183, 186, 187, 190.\\n\\nVv.

KEVIN STITT’S RENEWED\\nMOTION TO SET ORAL ARGUMENT\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nAfter this certified question of law was submitted to this Court, the Governor requested\\nan order setting a briefing schedule and setting the case for oral argument. See Gov’r’s Mot. to\\nSet Briefing Schedule and Oral Argument (May 16, 2024). The Court originally granted the\\nGovernor’s motion to set a briefing schedule but stated that the “Governor’s motion for oral\\nargument is deferred until after briefing is completed.” Order (May 22, 2024). When the Court\\nwithdrew the original briefing schedule and issued a subsequent order amending the briefing\\nschedule, it did not address the Governor’s pending motion for oral argument. See Order (Jun.\\n\\n7, 2024). The parties’ briefing concluded on July 23, 2024, and the Court instructed that “[nJo\\n\\nfurther briefing shall be permitted.” Jd. at 3. The Governor’s pending motion for oral argument\\n\\nch. 15, app. 1, Okla.Sup.Ct.R. 1.9. For the same reasons articulated in the Governor’s original\\n\\nmotion, oral argument could materially benefit the Court in resolving the certified question.\\n\\n\\nThe significant public importance of the certified question presented to this Court has\\nnot diminished in the two months since the Governor filed his original motion. In fact, the\\nsalience of the question presented has only intensified with the short passage of time. For\\ninstance, since this Court entered its June 7, 2024 Order, an Oklahoma County District Judge\\nstayed a case involving similar issues pending resolution of the certified question. See State of\\nOklahoma ex rel. Office of Mgmt. and Enterprise Serv. v. Kleo, Inc. d/b/a Classwallet, Dist.\\nCt. of Okla. Co., Case No. CJ-2024-619 (Dist. Co. of Okla. Co. filed 2024). In that case, the\\nAttorney General has asserted the right to take over—and immediately dismiss with\\nprejudice—litigation being prosecuted by special counsel appointed by the Governor.\\n\\nSetting this case for oral argument will allow the Governor and the Attorney General\\nthe opportunity to fully articulate their positions on a question of significant public importance\\nin the State of Oklahoma, and to address any questions the Court may have about recent public\\ndevelopments that magnify the dispute, including the Attorney General’s unprecedented\\nactions in the Oklahoma County matter. This will aid the Court in its resolution of this certified\\nquestion.\\n\\nMoreover, the parties’ briefing on the certified question involves the application of\\nvarious constitutional provisions, statutory provisions, and even the professional rules of\\nconduct. This question involving the intersection of constitutional and statutory provisions\\ndeserves careful consideration by the parties and the Court, especially because it involves the\\nauthority of public officials of the executive branch. And when a unique case such as this also\\nimplicates foundational tenets of attorneys’ professional responsibilities to a client, it warrants\\nspecial consideration given the potential impact on the legal profession. Oral argument could\\n\\nbe of assistance to the Court in its consideration of the important questions at issue.\\n\\nFinally, setting the case for oral argument would not materially prejudice any party or\\n\\nresult in undue delay.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Governor respectfully requests that this Court set this\\n\\ncase for oral argument at a time and date convenient for the Court.\\n\\n* pro hac vice application forthcoming\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nPay Eulkl\\n\\nJeffrey B.

The Attorney General strongly believes additional briefing in this matter is\\nunnecessaty. The federal district court issued a thorough memorandum opinion, part of which\\nclearly sets forth the Oklahoma statutes at issue and the lack of “established and controlling law”\\nnecessary to resolve this certified question. Memorandum Opinion & Order, Cherokee Nation v.\\nU.S. Dep't of the Interior, No. 20-2167 (TJX) (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2024), ECF No. 190 at 5-8. And the\\nAttorney General and Governor filed a combined seven briefs in Cherokee Nation related to the\\npresent issue. See ECF Nos. 176, 178-80, 183, 186-87. Additionally, the parties have recently\\nthoroughly briefed these issues in a district court case involving a nearly identical dispute, Oklahoma\\npy. KLEO, No. CJ-2024-619 (Okla. Cnty. Dist. Ct. Jan. 30, 2024). Finally, there is a pressing need\\nfor this Court to resolve the important question of who speaks for the State of Oklahoma in\\n\\nlitigation. Therefore, the Attorney Genetal requests the Court rule based on the extensive briefs\\n\\nalready submitted on this issue or, in the alternative, issue an abbreviated briefing schedule.\\n\\nIn support of his motion, the Attorney General shows as follows.\\n\\nA. It was not until the Governor requested this Court for a briefing schedule and oral\\natgument that he characterized the issues related to the certified question as\\n“complex.”\\n\\nBefore moving for a briefing schedule on May 16, 2024, the Governor had characterized\\nthe question before this Court as a simple one. Compare Governor’s Mot. at 4 (“the issues presented\\nby the certified question are complex”) with id. at 2 (“the question whether AG Drummond was\\nentitled to seize control of the federal district court litigation was not_a difficult one under\\nOklahoma law” (emphasis added) (citing ECF No. 186 at 2)). Specifically, the Governor\\npreviously argued that there was no need to burden this Court with a certified question because\\n“Oklahoma law provides in no uncertain terms that the Governor has the authority to retain\\ncounsel to represent him in litigation and that he wields the ‘Supreme Executive power’ and cannot\\nbe overruled by inferior executive officers.” ECF No. 186 at 2. The U'S. District Court noted the\\ndubiousness of this argument because “taken to its logical conclusion, Governor Stitt’s position\\nwould mean that there is xo sphere in which the Attorney General—an independently elected\\nconstitutional officer—may act to prosecute or defend the interests of the state against the wishes\\nof the Governor.” ECF. No. 190 at 8. Certainly, “Supreme Executive power” does not “sweep|]\\nthat broadly.” Id.\\n\\nWhether complex or not, this Court’s adjudication of the certified question, unless\\nreformulated, will involve consideration of two sections of Title 74 and one section of the\\nOklahoma Constitution. ECF No. 195 at 1. The Governor made no proposed edits to the\\nformulated question, ECF No. 192, and otherwise provided no “established and controlling law,”\\nECF No. 190 at 8, which would resolve the question of law after having at least four previous\\nopportunities to do so. ECF Nos. 178, 180, 186, 192. Thus, the Governor’s own written word and\\n\\npractices before the U.S. District Court do not provide support for his new claim that the issue\\n\\n\\nbefore this Court 1s complex. The Attorney General respectfully asks this Court to either strike\\nthe briefing schedule or issue an abbreviated briefing schedule because it already possesses the\\narguments of the parties in relation to the certified question. The Governor does not need several\\nadditional months to brief issues that were heretofore simple.\\n\\nB. The Attorney General presented his arguments to the U.S. District Court in support\\nof his authority and duty to take and control litigation when in the interest of the\\nstate and its people. To the extent the Governor believes his arguments to the\\nconttaty were left underdeveloped, it was not for lack of opportunity.\\n\\nThe Governor’s claim that “the parties did not have an opportunity to fully brief” issues\\nrelated to the certified question before the U.S. District Court is incorrect and perplexing.\\nGovertnor’s Mot. at 4. The Attorney General filed notice of his appearance on July 25, 2023. See\\nECF No. 176. In that filing, the Attorney General provided the legal basis for granting him\\nauthority to take and control litigation. Jd. Following that, the parties filed a combined six more\\nbriefs containing argument related to this certified question. See ECF Nos. 178-80, 183, 186-87.\\nMore than eight months passed after the Attorney General filed his notice of appearance before\\nthe U.S. District Court ultimately certified the question of law to this Court. See ECF No. 195.\\nThe Governor never complained of a lack of opportunity to develop his arguments before the\\nfederal court, and it is only before this Court that he claims the numerous previous opportunities\\nto brief were insufficient. That claim should be given no credence because it lacks support in the\\nrecord.\\n\\nThe U.S. District Court no doubt believed the briefing was adequate to justify its\\ncertification order. Otherwise, the court would not have been able to craft the thorough analysis\\nin its memorandum opinion justifying its order to certify this question of law. See ECF No. 190.\\nThis Court’s decision in this important matter should not be delayed five additional months\\nbecause the Governor now incorrectly claims he lacked adequate opportunity to develop his\\n\\narguments in three prior briefs he filed on this issue with the U.S. District Court.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nC. This Court’s decision will resolve vital issues in active litigation involving state and\\ntribal interests, which justifies the Attorney General’s request to eliminate, or in the\\nalternative, accelerate briefing.\\n\\nThe Governor previously expressed concern in the U.S. District Court for any delay that\\ncertification may cause, ECF No. 186 at 5. Yet, his request for additional briefing necessarily\\nresults in further delay. One would expect that if his concerns were earnest, the Governor would\\nhave utilized his several opportunities to fully develop his arguments before the U.S. District\\nCourt, supra Section B. By operation of the Governor’s claimed inability to fully develop his\\narguments below and request for additional briefing, resolution in this matter and others is further\\ndelayed. The Attorney General simply asks that the delay be shortened for the sake of resolution\\nof these important pending matters.\\n\\nD. If the Court remains inclined to permit additional briefing, the Attorney General\\nsuggests that the parties be given 20 days to file simultaneous briefs on the certified\\nquestion and 10 days to file any response.\\n\\nThe Attorney General, not the Governor, sought certification of the subject question to\\nthis Court. See ECF No. 183. As a result, to the extent additional briefing were required, it does\\nnot make sense for the Governor to file the first brief in this case. Nevertheless, as a compromise,\\nthe Attorney General suggests that the parties be ordered to file simultaneous briefing in this\\nmatter.\\n\\nAs to the timing, the Attorney General believes that 20 days is more than adequate time\\nfor the patties to file their opening briefs. In addition to the seven briefs filed with the U.S. District\\nCourt, the Attorney General and yet another outside attorney hired by the Governor recently\\ncompleted thorough briefing on these issues in an Oklahoma County District Court case,\\nOklahoma v. KLEO, No. CJ-2024-619 (Okla. Cnty. Dist. Ct. Jan. 30, 2024). In KLEO, the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral entered his appearance on behalf of Oklahoma on February 12, 2024, and dismissed with\\n\\nprejudice frivolous claims purportedly initiated by the Governot’s office that had been repudiated\\n\\n\\nby independent federal and state audits. In response, the Governot’s hired counsel raised the same\\narguments implicated in the certified question. Therefore, the Attorney General believes the\\nparties can easily summarize the prior briefing on these issues in 20 days and respond to the\\narguments already raised by the parties 10 days thereafter.\\nCONCLUSION\\nWHEREFORE, Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond respectfully requests\\nthis Court strike its prior briefing schedule or, in the alternative, expedite its previous briefing\\nschedule ordering the Governor and the Attorney General to file simultaneous opening briefs\\nwithin twenty (20) days of issuance of the expedited order with response briefs, if any, filed within\\nten (10) days after the conclusion of the opening brief deadline.\\n\\nRespectfully Submitted,\\n\\nGENTNER DRUMMOND, OBA #16645\\nAttorney General\\n\\nGARRY M.

U.S. Department of the Interior, No.\\n1:20-cv-02167 (D.D.C.) (‘DC Gaming Litigation”). The Attorney General respectfully submits\\nthat this Court should conclude, in response to the District Court’s certified question, that the\\nAttorney General may:\\n\\n“take and assume control” of the “defense of the state’s interests,” 74 O.S. §\\n\\n18b(A)(3), in the DC Gaming Litigation—in which the Governor of Oklahoma is\\n\\nnamed as a defendant in his official capacity for his role in entering into certain\\n\\ntribal-gaming contracts on behalf of the State of Oklahoma—over the objection\\n\\nof the Governor, who is vested with “Supreme [E]xecutive power” under Article\\n\\nVI, Section 2 of the Oklahoma Constitution, and when the Governor has already\\n\\nexercised his authority under Title 74, Section 6 of the Oklahoma Statutes to\\n\\n“employ counsel to protect the rights or interests of the state,” 74 O.S. § 6.\\nOrder Certifying Question of Law to the Okla. Supreme Ct. at 1.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe Attorney General appears in this case to do what the Governor will not: Protect the\\ninterests of the State and defend the holdings of its Supreme Court. This Court has made clear:\\n“In the absence of explicit legislative or constitutional expression to the contrary, [the Attorney\\nGeneral] possesses complete dominion over every litigation in which he properly appears in the\\ninterest of the State... .” State ex rel. Derryberry v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 1973 OK 132, J 20, 516 P.2d\\n813, 818. There is no explicit legislative or constitutional expression to the contrary available to\\nthe Governor in the DC Gaming Litigation. The controlling legislative command hete is that “the\\nAttorney General may, if the Attorney General deems it advisable and to the best interest of the\\nstate, take and assume control of the prosecution or defense of the state’s interest” in litigation.\\n74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3). As this Court has twice held that the Governor lacked authority to enter into\\nthe agreements at issue in the DC Gaming Litigation, the duty of the Attorney General to represent\\n\\nthe State’s interests could not be clearer. Neither the Governor’s “Supreme Executive power” »\\nP\\n\\nunder Article VI, Section 2 of the Oklahoma Constitution, nor his authority under Title 74, Section\\n\\n1\\n\\n6 of the Oklahoma Statutes to “employ counsel to protect the rights or interests of the state,”\\npermits him to speak for the State by ignoring State law.\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nThe certified question in this case arose because the Oklahoma Attorney General was\\ncompelled to assume control of Oklahoma’s interests in the DC Gaming Litigation to put an end\\nto the Governor’s neglect of his duty to “cause the laws of the State to be faithfully executed,”\\nOKLA. CONST. art. 6, § 8, and enforce two decisions of this Court that are binding on the\\nGovernor. In 2020, the Governor entered “into new tribal gaming compacts with the Comanche\\nNation and Otoe-Missouria Tribes.” Treat v. Sutt, 2020 OK 64, ¥ 2, 473 P.3d 43, 44 (Treat I). “The\\ntribal gaming compacts were submitted to the United States Department of the Interior, and the\\nDepartment of the Interior deemed them approved by inaction, only to the extent they are\\nconsistent with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA).” Jd. In submitting the gaming\\ncompacts to the United States Department of the Interior, the Governor was required to certify\\nthat “he is authorized under State law to enter into the compact[s].” 25 C.F.R. § 293.8(c). Attorney\\nGeneral Mike Hunter opined officially that the Governor lacked authority to enter into these\\ncompacts. 2020 OK AG 8. This Court then agreed that the Governor lacked authority and\\nconcluded that the “tribal gaming compacts Governor Stitt entered into with the Comanche\\nNation and Otoe-Missouria Tribes ate invalid under Oklahoma law.” Treat I, 2020 OK 64, { 8,\\n473 P.3d at 45.\\n\\n“While Treat I was pending before this Court, the Executive branch entered into two\\nadditional compacts with the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians and the Kialegee\\nTribal Town.” Treat v. Stitt, 2021 OK 3, J 2, 481 P.3d 240, 241 (Treat Il). These purported compacts\\nwere also “submitted . . . to the United States Department of the Interior.” Id. Even though this\\n\\nCourt’s opinion in Treat I was originally issued on July 21, 2020, “the Department of the Interior\\n\\ndeemed [the two new compacts] approved by inaction, only to the extent they are consistent with\\nthe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA).” Id. This Court again concluded that the Governor\\nlacked authority and “the new tribal gaming compacts are invalid under Oklahoma law.” Id. {| 12,\\n481 P.3d at 244.\\n\\nAfter twice being told by this Court—the final arbiter of Oklahoma law—that he had no\\nauthority to execute the subject gaming agreements, the Governor had a constitutional duty to\\nhonor this Court’s binding precedent and “cause the laws of the State to be faithfully executed . .\\n_ 2? OKLA. CONST. art. 6, § 8. He did just the opposite. Turning his back on decisions that bind\\nhim, he sought to use federal law to commandeer the State and force it to honor agreements that\\nundeniably violate Oklahoma law. Specifically, after the Cherokee Nation, Chickasaw Nation,\\nChoctaw Nation, and Citizen Potawatomi Nation sued the United States Department of the\\nInterior, the Governor, and others in the DC Gaming Litigation over the illegal gaming compacts,\\nthe Governor has continued to vigorously argue that the federal court should disregard Oklahoma\\nlaw and find the illegal tribal gaming compacts are still fully enforceable. See, eg, Doc. 154-1 at\\n17-23.\"\\n\\nBy July 2023, the Attorney General plus both branches of the Legislature were justifiably\\nalarmed by the Governor’s actions in the DC Gaming Litigation, purportedly on behalf of the\\nState of Oklahoma. On his own initiative and at the urging of the Oklahoma House of\\nRepresentatives and the Oklahoma Senate, the Attorney General entered an appearance in the DC\\nGaming Litigation “for J. Kevin Stitt, in his official capacity as the Governor of the State of\\nOklahoma, solely for the purpose of protecting the interests of the State of Oklahoma.” Docs.\\n176 and 177. The Governor moved to strike the Attorney General’s (and Solicitor General’s)\\n\\nappearance in the DC Gaming Litigation. Doc. 178. After the Govetnor’s request to strike was\\n\\n1 The “Doc.” citations refer to the docket entries in the DC Gaming Litigation.\\n\\n3\\n\\nfully briefed, the certified question of who rightfully represents the State of Oklahoma in the DC\\nGaming Litigation followed. Doc. 195.\\nARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\\n\\nI. The Attorney General Has Authority to Take and Assume Control of the State’s\\nDefense in the DC Gaming Litigation from the Governor.\\n\\nAs this Court has squarely held: “The Attorney General, by statute, 74 O.S.1971 [§] 18 is\\nthe Chief Law Officer of the State. In the absence of explicit legislative or constitutional expression\\nto the contrary, he possesses complete dominion over every litigation in which he properly\\nappears in the interest of the State, whether or not there is a relator or some other nominal\\nparty.” Derryberry, 1973 OK 132, ¥ 20, 516 P.2d at 818 (emphasis added).\\n\\nIn the DC Gaming Litigation, the Governor was sued in his official capacity, Doc. 26 at {|\\n15, which effectively makes this a suit against the State. Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 US.\\n58, 71 (1989) (“{A] suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the\\nofficial but rather is a suit against the official’s office . . . [a]s such, it is no different from a suit\\nagainst the State itself.””) (citation omitted). And the Attorney General properly entered an\\nappearance for the State to protect its interests, as he was plainly authorized to do. In 1995, 74\\nO.S. § 18b(A)(3) was amended to permit the Attorney General to appeat in litigation involving\\nthe interests of the State on his or her own initiative.’ In addition, consistent with 74 OS. §\\n18b(A)(3), the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Senate both requested the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral take and assume control of the State’s interest in the DC Gaming Litigation. Docs. 176-\\n\\n2 Corporation Commission—Oil and Gas—Revenue and Taxation—Apportionment of Excise Tax\\nMonies, 1995 Okla. Sess. Law Serv. ch. 328, § 12; see a/so State ex rel, Pruitt v. Steidley, 2015 OK CR 6, {ff 15—-\\n16, 349 P.3d 554, 558 (recognizing that the authority of the Attorney General in 74 O.S. § 18b was expanded\\nin 1995).\\n\\n1 and 176-2.° Therefore, absent an “explicit legislative or constitutional expression to the contrary,\\n[the Attorney General] possesses complete dominion” over the DC Gaming Litigation, z¢., the\\nAttorney General may make the exclusive litigation decisions on behalf of the State in the DC\\nGaming Litigation. Derryberry, 1973 OK 132, J 20, 516 P.2d at 818. There are none here—as shown\\nbelow—and that resolves the certified question in this case.\\n\\nA. Section 18b of Title 74 Gives the Attorney General Express Discretion to\\nTake and Assume Control of Any Litigation Involving the State.\\n\\nThe Oklahoma Constitution provides that: “The Executive authority of the state shall be\\nvested in a Governor, . . . Attorney General, . . . and other officers provided by law and this\\nConstitution, each of whom... shall perform such duties as may be designated in this Constitution\\nor prescribed by law.” OKLA. CONST. att. 6, § 1(A). Thus, Oklahoma does not consolidate all\\nexecutive power in a single officer. The Constitution instead divides power among the executive\\nofficers and reserves the Legislature’s power to prescribe those officers’ duties. Wentz v. Thomas,\\n1932 OK 636, J 27, 15 P.2d 65, 69. The Constitution’s establishment of the office of Attorney\\nGeneral carries with it all the common-law powers associated with that office, modified as\\nnecessary to be consistent with the Oklahoma Statutes and Constitution. Derryberry, 1973 OK 132,\\n{ 27, 516 P.2d at 819. As a result, “fiJn the absence of explicit legislative or constitutional\\nexpression to the contrary, [the Attorney General] possesses complete dominion over every\\n\\nlitigation in which he properly appears in the interest of the State . . ..” Id. {j 20, 516 P.2d at 818.\\n\\n3 The Speaker of the Oklahoma House and President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma Senate both have\\nauthority to engage legal counsel on behalf of their respective bodies. See Okla. House Rule 1.6, available at\\nhttps://dgbf0g52sf910.cloudfront.net/House Rules 59th Oklahoma Legislature 2023 2024 49464075\\n\\nf1.pdfeupdated_at=2023-02-28T23:08:02.268Z (stating “[t]he Speaker may authorize or engage legal\\ncounsel on behalf of the House”); Senate Rule 2.4(A), available at https://oksenate.gov/senate-tules#1-rule-\\n2-4 (stating “{t]he President Pro Tempore shall be the chief executive officer of the Senate and shall\\npresctibe all policies not otherwise provided by law or by the rules.”). This authorized them to request the\\nAttorney General to take legal action in the case, on behalf of each of their respective legislative chambers.\\n\\nThat conclusion is confirmed by the Legislature’s exercise of its power to “prescribe[] by\\nlaw” the powers of the Attorney General, by expressly providing that “the Attorney General as\\nthe chief law officer of the state” has the power and duty:\\n\\nTo initiate or appear in any action in which the interests of the state or the people\\n\\nof the state are at issue, or to appear at the request of the Governor, the Legislature,\\n\\nor either branch thereof, and prosecute and defend in any court or before any\\n\\ncommission, board or officers any cause ot proceeding, civil or criminal, in which\\nthe state may be a party or interested; and when so appearing in any such cause of\\n\\nproceeding, the Attorney General may, if the Attorney General deems it\\nadvisable and to the best interest of the state, take and assume control of\\n\\nthe prosecution or defense of the state’s interest therein.\\n\\n74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3) (emphasis added). The statute contains neither exceptions nor caveats, Z.€., it\\ndoes not say the Attorney General may act “except if the Governor objects” or “as long as the\\nGovernor has not retained legal counsel.” Therefore, under the plain and unambiguous terms of\\n74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3), the Attorney General can properly appear in, and take control of, litigation\\ninvolving the State from anyone, including the Governor.\\n\\nB. Oklahoma’s Constitution Does Not Limit the Attorney General’s Power to\\nTake and Assume Control of the State’s Defense in Litigation.\\n\\nThe Governor has previously suggested that the Oklahoma Constitution’s reference to the\\nGovernor’s having “Supreme Executive power” somehow means that he can overtule the\\nAttorney General—Oklahoma’s “chief law officer,” 74 O.S. § 18—in litigation. But this Court’s\\nrepeated pronouncements on the scope of the Governot’s power under the Constitution rejects\\nthat suggestion.\\n\\nThis Court has had to remind the Governor multiple times recently about the limitations\\non his power under Oklahoma’s constitutional framework. Just three months ago, in the most\\nrecent Shit v. Treat case, this Court once again reiterated that “[t]he Governor is without authority\\nto exercise a discretion not validly and specifically granted by the statutory law and not within the\\n\\npower conferred upon the Chief Executive by the Constitution.” Swi »v. Treat, 2024 OK 21, { 21,\\n\\n546 P.3d 882, 891 (Treat IIT) (quoting Ritter v. State, 2022 OK 73, ¥ 15, 520 P.3d 370, 379). As the\\nCourt also recently explained in R#er, on which Treat III relied,\\n\\nOklahoma’s historical underpinnings were economically conservative. Fearing\\n\\nexcessive power in the hands of one individual, the framers of the Oklahoma\\n\\nConstitution intentionally created a weak state chief executive. The Governor’s\\n\\nauthority is limited by the Constitution, because the Chief Executive may exercise only\\n\\nthe power specifically granted by the Legislature.’ The Governor 7s without authority to exetcise\\n\\na discretion not validly and specifically granted by the statutory law and not within\\n\\nthe power conferred upon the Chief Executive by the Constitution.\\n\\n2022 OK 73, | 15, 520 P.3d at 379 (emphasis added).\\n\\nThis Court illustrated the application of this rule in Treat II, concluding that because\\ncompacting with Indian tribes is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution, the Governot’s\\ncompacting authority is limited to that provided to him by Oklahoma statutory law. 2024 OK 21,\\nq 21, 546 P.3d at 891. Similarly, here, there is nothing in the Oklahoma Constitution expressly\\naddressing the filing of or defending litigation by the State, or more importantly, providing the\\nGovernor authority to overrule the Attorney General in litigation. As a result, the Governor’s\\nauthority in litigation is limited to what he is allowed to do under Oklahoma statutory law. And as\\njust explained, Oklahoma law prescribes that the Attorney General is the officer with discretion\\nto “take and assume control of” litigation involving the interests of the State. 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3).\\nTherefore, the power of the Attorney General is supreme in litigation involving the interests of\\nthe State.\\n\\nThe Governor’s past efforts to rely on Article 6, Section 2 have threatened to eviscerate\\nthe power of the Attorney General and undermine the Legislature. As the federal district court in\\nthe DC Gaming Litigation observed:\\n\\n[T]Jaken to its logical conclusion, Governor Stitt’s position [that the Oklahoma\\n\\nConstitution’s allowance for shared power among executives should bend to his\\n\\nprerogative] would mean that there is no sphere in which the Attorney General—an\\n\\nindependently elected constitutional officer—may act to prosecute or defend the interests\\n\\nof the state against the wishes of the Governor. Whatever “Supreme Executive power’’\\nmeans under the Oklahoma Constitution; the Court is skeptical that it sweeps that broadly.\\n\\n7\\n\\nDoc. 190 at 8. The Oklahoma Constitution prevents this result by dividing power among the\\nexecutive officers and reserving the Legislature’s power to prescribe those officers’ powers. Wentz,\\n1932 OK 636, J 27, 15 P.2d at 69. If the Governor could prevent the Attorney General from\\ndefending the State’s interests, he would undermine one of the key powers of the Attorney\\nGeneral—one that the Legislature has said he may wield. “Supreme Executive power” refers only\\nto the power held by the Governor within his sphere; it is not a sword that he may use to lop off\\nthe powers of other constitutional officers.\\n\\nIn any event, whatever the scope of the Governor’s share of executive power, it cannot\\nbe read to extinguish his obligation to “cause the laws of the State to be faithfully executed.”\\nOKLA. CONST. art. 6, § 8. Yet that is what he seeks to do here: prevent the Attorney General from\\ntaking over litigation to advocate for the State to comply with this Court’s rulings.\\n\\nTherefore, the Court should reject the Governor’s constitutional arguments, which would\\nessentially make the Attorney General’s obligation to protect the interests of the State subservient\\nto the Governor’s will. Nothing in the Oklahoma Constitution authorizes that hierarchy, much\\nless expressly precludes the Attorney General from taking and assuming control of litigation\\ninvolving the State over the Governot’s objection.\\n\\nC. Sections 6 and 18c of Title 74 Do Not Give the Governor the Ability to\\nOverrule the Attorney General in this Litigation.\\n\\nThe Governor will likely continue to claim that his ability to employ counsel in 74 OS. §\\n6 “to protect the rights or interests of the state” means that the Attorney General cannot take and\\nassume control litigation of the State’s interest from the Governor. But the Attorney General’s\\npower to “take and assume control” of litigation of the State’s interests, 74 O.S. § 18b(A)()\\n\\nauthorizes the Attorney General to do just that. Furthermore, the Governor cannot claim that\\n\\ndefiance of this Court’s rulings in cases to which he was a party somehow “protect[s] the rights or\\ninterests of the state.”\\n\\nOver a century ago, the Legislature prescribed that the Governor has the statutory\\nauthority to employ counsel. See zd. § 6. But that authority was gap-filling, and provided a method\\nby which the State’s interests could be protected when the State’s typical legal representative was\\ndisqualified or unable to act, see Vers v. State, 1913 OK CR 250, 134 P. 80, 86, or by which the\\nGovernor could appoint counsel when necessary to assist, not supersede, the State’s typical legal\\nrepresentative, see State v. Hudson, 1929 OK CR 287, 279 P. 921, 922.\\n\\nHowever, that authority does not diminish the Attorney General’s own power over\\nlitigation, as “[i]n the absence of explicit legislative or constitutional expression to the contrary,\\n[the Oklahoma Attorney General] possesses complete dominion over every litigation in which he\\nproperly appears in the interest of the State.” Derryberry, 1973 OK 132, { 20, 516 P.2d at 818. There\\nis no explicit legislative or constitutional expression that the Governor can supersede the Attorney\\nGeneral’s complete dominion over litigation. Just the opposite, the more recently enacted statute—\\n74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3)-clearly and unambiguously states that the Attorney General has the power,\\non his own initiative, to “take and assume control of the prosecution or defense of the state’s\\ninterest” in litigation. Consequently, while the Governor is free to employ legal counsel, if the\\nAttorney General concludes it is in the best interests of the State, the Attorney General has the »\\nexpress power and duty to take and assume control of the State’s interests in the litigation (even\\nif the Governor has previously employed legal counsel in the case). These provisions do not\\n\\ndirectly conflict—but if they did, Section 18b(A)(3) is the more recent enactment and therefore\\n\\n4 Regardless, as explained below, the Governor has abdicated his legislative authorization to retain counsel\\nfor the State because he is not seeking to “to protect the rights or interests of the state.” Id.\\n\\n9\\n\\ncontrols against the older Section 6. See Duncan v. Okla. Dep’t of Corr, 2004 OK 58, {] 6, 95 P.3d\\n1076, 1079 (citing M/ton v. Hayes, 1989 OK 12, 770 P.2d 14, 15).\\n\\nWhen the Legislature wished to give the Governor the power to employ counsel that\\ndisplaced other prosecutors, it knew how to do so. In 1908, around the time it enacted 74 O.S. §\\n6, the Legislature passed a law, 1908 Okla. Sess. Laws 594, authorizing the Governor to appoint\\ncounsel to enforce prohibition laws “and the other laws of the state.” See Childs v. State, 1910 OK\\nCR 230, 113 P. 545, 546. That law, since repealed, provided that the special counsel “shall have all\\nthe powers of county attorneys in their respective counties” and that the Governor could “call\\nupon the Attorney General or his assistant” to enforce the prohibition laws “in lieu of, or in\\naddition to,” the appointed counsel. Id. Therefore, the Legislature plainly knows how to authorize\\nthe Governor to appoint counsel who can take the place of the Attorney General. In contrast,\\nSection 6 does not provide such authority to the Governor; it does not mention the Attorney\\nGeneral at all. In 1995, the Legislature expanded the Attorney General’s Section 18b power to\\n“assume control” of litigation while leaving the Governor’s Section 6 authority untouched.\\nTherefore, 74 O.S. § 6 does not give the Governor license to overrule the Attorney General in\\nlitigation.\\n\\nThe Governor may also continue to selectively quote 74 O.S. § 18c(A) to create the\\nimpression that his ability to employ legal counsel in 74 O.S. § 6 somehow supersedes the Attorney\\nGeneral’s ability to take control of litigation of the State’s interests. This is a misrepresentation of\\nlaw. Subsection A of Section 18c offers only the general instruction that: “Except as otherwise\\nprovided by this subsection, no state officer, board or commission shall have authority to employ\\nof appoint attorneys to advise or represent said officer, board or commission in any matter.” 74\\n\\nO.S. § 18c(A)(1). This subsection then discusses which state officers, boards, and commissions\\n\\n10\\n\\nhave authority to retain legal counsel without obtaining the permission of the Attorney General.\\nThe Governor is identified in Section 18c(A) as one of the parties permitted to retain legal counsel.\\n\\nThe bare ability to employ legal counsel is fundamentally different than the Attorney —\\nGeneral’s discretion to “take and assume contro!” of litigation of the State’s interests. Accordingly,\\nthe Governor’s authority to retain counsel has no effect on the Attorney General’s authority to\\nassume control of litigation of the State’s interests in this or any other proceeding. Therefore, 74\\nO.S. §§ 6 and 18c do not in any way give the Governor license to overrule the Attorney General’s\\n“complete dominion” over litigation involving the interests of the State.\\n\\nD. Even if 74 O.S. § 6 Were Relevant to the Attorney General’s Authority to\\n\\nTake and Assume Control of the DC Gaming Litigation, the Governor\\nNevertheless Lacks Authority to Retain Legal Counsel on Behalf of the\\nState in This Case.\\n\\nThe Governor’s statutory authority to employ counsel is limited to efforts “to protect the\\nrights or interests of the state.” 74 O.S. § 6. As previously discussed, in an unprecedented attempt\\nto undermine Oklahoma’s sovereignty, the Governor inexplicably sought to use federal law to\\nforce Oklahoma to honor illegal agreements with Tribal Nations. See, ¢g, Doc. 154-1. The\\nGovernor is not seeking “to protect the rights or interests of the state” when he asks a federal\\ncourt to disregard Oklahoma law and binding precedent of this Court. There can be no legitimate\\nState interest in enforcing compacts this Court ruled were unlawful. Consequently, the Governor\\nlacks authority to retain counsel to represent the State in this matter pursuant to 74 O.S. § 6. This\\ncompelled the action by the Attorney General to take and assume control of the State’s defense\\nin the DC Gaming Litigation.\\n\\nE. Oklahoma’s Express Grant of Power to the Attorney General to Take and\\n\\nAssume Control of Litigation Controls over Any Contradictory Common-\\nLaw Limitations.\\n\\nThe Governor will likely rely on cases such as Ré/ey v. Cornerstone Cmty. Outreach, Inc., 57 So.\\n\\n3d 704, 728-29 (Ala. 2010), to argue that an attorney general at common law did not have the\\n11\\n\\n\\npower to overrule the king. Of course, Oklahoma has no king,’ nor even a unitary executive.\\nAlthough the “common law duties and powers” of the attorney general attach themselves to the\\nAttorney General of Oklahoma, they do so only “fi]n the absence of express statutory or\\nconstitutional restrictions” and only “as far as they are applicable and in harmony with our system\\nof government.” Derryberry, 1973 OK 132, § 25, 516 P.2d at 818-19. And the Oklahoma\\nConstitution provides that the executive authority of the State “shall be vested in a Governor [and]\\nAttorney General... each of whom .. . shall perform such duties as may be designated in this\\nConstitution or prescribed by law.” OKLA. CONST. art. 6, § 1(A). The Legislature, which prescribes\\nthe law, see OKLA. CONST. art. 5, §§ 1, 36, “has the power to not only add to [the Attorney\\nGeneral’s powets and duties], but may lessen or limit the common law duties which attached\\nto the office under common law.” State ex rel. Cartwright v. Ga.-Pac. Corp., 1982 OK 148, ¥ 6, 663\\nP.2d 718, 720 (emphasis added).\\n\\nHere, the Oklahoma Legislature has clearly and unambiguously done so, by prescribing\\nthat “the Attorney General may, if the Attorney General deems it advisable and to the best interest\\nof the state, take and assume control of the prosecution or defense of the state’s interest” in\\nlitigation. 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3). Again, there is nothing in this statute that limits the Attorney\\nGeneral’s power to take and assume the prosecution or defense of litigation, even if the Governor\\n\\nobjects. As a result, regardless of any common-law limitation on an attorney general’s power to\\n\\nNor does it have a governor with powers like that of the Governor of Alabama, whose powets were at\\nissue in Riley, see 57 So. 3d at 722-23 (quoting Op. of the Justs., 156 So. 2d 639, 642—43 (Ala. 1963) (concluding\\nthat the Governor of Alabama may exercise executive power to prevent court-ordered school desegregation\\n“even in the absence of a specific grant of authority by the legislature”).\\n\\n6 While this quote comes ftom this Court’s description of the differing views between states over the\\npowers vested in attorneys general, the remainder of the opinion makes clear that this is the view adopted\\nin Oklahoma. Id. Ff 8-12, 663 P.2d at 721 (discussing the modifications made by the Legislature to the\\nOklahoma Attorney General’s common law powers).\\n\\n12\\n\\ntake and assume litigation in other states, Oklahoma’s Legislature has modified and expanded its\\nAttorney General’s ability to take and assume control of litigation.\\n\\nF, The Rules of Professional Conduct Do Not Prohibit the Attorney General’s\\nActions in This Case.\\n\\nThe Governor may also assert that it would somehow violate the Rules of Professional\\nConduct for the Attorney General to take over the case from the Governor due to their conflicting\\nviews on how it should be litigated. The Governor’s prior arguments suggest that he believes that\\nhe personally is the Attorney General’s client. Thus, the Governor believes the Attorney General\\nmust abide his “decisions concerning the objectives of representation” and must consult with him\\n“as to the means by which they are to be pursued.” Doc. 178 at 4 (citing 5 O.S., ch. 1, app. 3-A,\\nRule 1.2).\\n\\nThe obvious flaw in this argument is that the Attorney General has not sought to represent\\nthe Governot’s personal interests in the DC Gaming Litigation. The Attorney General in the DC\\nGaming Litigation, just like all other litigation involving his office, is simply seeking to represent\\nthe State of Oklahoma’s interests. See Doc. 176 at 4 (the Attorney General entered his appearance\\n“solely for the purpose of protecting the interests of the State of Oklahoma”). After all, the\\nGovernor has admitted in the DC Gaming Litigation that the State of Oklahoma is the real party\\nin interest. Doc. 110 at 1. Thus, the Attorney General’s client is the State of Oklahoma, not the\\nGovernor. See State ex rel. Nesbitt v. Dist. Ct. of Mayes Cty., 1967 OK 228, J 17, 440 P.2d 700, 707\\n(when the Attorney General appears in a case to defend the State’s interests, the nominal party\\ncannot “by any acts of her own, unsanctioned and acquiesced in by the Attorney General,” defeat\\nhis decisions on how to litigate the case for the State), overruled on other grounds by Palmer v. Belford,\\n1974 OK 73, 527 P.2d 589. To be sure, as a matter of wisdom and respect, the Attorney General\\nwill often consult with and take into consideration the views of the officeholders he represents in\\n\\ntheir official capacities, including the Governor. But the Attorney General is not required to defer\\n\\n13\\n\\nto their positions—especially not when they conflict with Oklahoma law. Accordingly, there is no\\nconflict of interest or requirement that the Attorney General abide by the Governor’s litigation\\nobjectives.\\n\\nThus, the Attorney General can assume control of litigation involving the State if he deems\\nit advisable. Once he assumes control of the litigation, he has “complete dominion” over the\\nState’s interest in the htigation, including overruling the Governotr’s litigation objectives.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFor these reasons, the Attorney General respectfully requests the Court answer the\\ncertified question from the DC Gaming Litigation as follows:\\n\\nThe Attorney General may “take and assume control” of the “defense of the state’s\\n\\ninterests,’ 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3), in the DC Gaming Litigation—in which the Governor of\\n\\nOklahoma is named as a defendant in his official capacity for his role in entering into\\n\\ncertain tribal-gaming contracts on behalf of the State of Oklahoma—and the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral may do so over the objection of the Governor, who is vested with “Supreme\\n\\nExecutive power” under Article VI, Section 2 of the Oklahoma Constitution, and after the\\n\\nGovernor has already exercised his authority under Title 74, Section 6 of the Oklahoma\\n\\nStatutes to “employ counsel to protect the rights or interests of the state,” 74 OS. § 6.\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\nRespectfully Submitted,\\n\\nGENTNER DRUMMOND, OBA #16645\\nAttorney General\\n\\nGARRY M.

This Court’s prior precedents on the Attorney General’s\\nauthority in litigation involving the State are clear. Specifically, “[i]n the absence of explicit\\nlegislative or constitutional expression to the contrary, [the Attorney General] possesses complete\\ndominion over every litigation in which he properly appears in the interest of the State... .” State\\nex rel. Derryberry v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 1973 OK 132, 4 20, 516 P.2d 813, 818. No such explicit\\nlegislative or constitutional expression to the contrary is implicated here. Further, the Governor's\\ncontinued assertion of broad constitutional powers have been repeatedly rejected by this Court\\neven with the benefit of oral argument. See Treat v.

Br. at 17 (emphasis added). This\\nillustrates the Governor’s nescience in this matter. This dispute is not about who represents the\\nGovernot’s individual interests. This case is about who represents the State of Oklahoma’s interest\\nin the DC Gaming Litigation. The Governor’s individual interests are not relevant.\\n\\nWhat matters are the State’s interests. And Oklahoma law clearly and unambiguously vests\\nits chief law officer, the Attorney General, with the power and responsibility to represent\\nOklahoma’s interests in litigation. 74 O.S. §§ 18, 18b. The parties have previously thoroughly\\naddressed these issues in the DC Gaming Litigation and other forums. As a result, the Attorney\\nGeneral in his brief-in-chief preemptively addressed most of the Governor’s arguments, and he\\nwill limit this reply to the more nuanced arguments advanced by the Governor.\\n\\nIn summary, this Court has had to remind the Governor on an almost yearly basis that he\\n“is without authority to exercise a discretion not validly and specifically granted by the statutory\\nlaw and not within the power conferred upon the Chief Executive by the Constitution.” Sit ».\\nTreat, 2024 OK 21, 4 21, 546 P.3d 882, 891 (“Treat IP’) (quoting Ritter v. State, 2022 OK 73, § 15,\\n520 P.3d 370, 379). Here, the Governor has not identified any constitutional provision addressing\\nwho controls litigation involving the State. Therefore, Oklahoma statutory law controls. See OKLA.\\nCONST. art. 5, § 36. Subsection A(3) of 74 O.S. § 18b specifically gives the Attorney General power\\nto “take and assume control of the prosecution or defense of the state’s interest” in litigation if\\nthe Attorney General “deems it advisable and to the best interest of the state.” The Governor\\ndoes not claim that 74 O.S. § 18b is unconstitutional, and he has not identified any statute giving\\nthe Governor similar express power to take and assume control of litigation. Thus, Subsection\\nA(3) of 74 O.S. § 18b is dispositive here and resolves the certified question in the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral’s favor.\\n\\nA. The Governor’s Discretion to Request the Attorney General Enter an\\nAppearance in Litigation Does Not Mean the Attorney General Must\\nFollow the Governor’s Directives in Litigation.\\n\\nThe Governor accuses the Attorney General of myopically focusing on “a single word or\\nphrase” in 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3) when it is the Governor who does just that. Gov. Br. at 9-10\\n(quoting Stricklen v. Multiple Injury Tr. Fund, 2024 OK 1, ¥ 19, 542 P.3d 858, 868). Specifically, the\\nGovernor argues that the phrase “or to appear at the request of the Governor” somehow means\\nthe Governor’s authority to control litigation is superior to the Attorney General’s. That 1s\\nnonsensical, as shown by an examination of “the statutory context wherein the particular . . .\\nphrase appears,” in accord with the principle that “[w]ords used in a part of a statute must be\\ninterpreted in light of their context and understood in a sense that harmonizes with all other parts\\nof the statute.” Strick/en, 2024 OK 1, J 19, 542 P.3d at 867-68 (quotation omitted).\\n\\nSubsection A(3) of 74 O.S. § 18b contains two parts separated by a semicolon. The first\\npart—the phrase relied on by the Governor—discusses only when the Attorney General may\\ninitiate or enter an appearance in litigation. It gives the Attorney General the power to enter an\\nappearance on his own initiative, “or” at the request of the Governor, the Legislature, “or either\\nbranch thereof.” § 18b(A)(3). “{O]r is a ‘disjunctive particle used to express an alternative or give\\na choice of one among two or more things.” Toch, LLC ». City of Tulsa, 2020 OK 81, {j 25, 474\\nP.3d 859, 867 (quoting Or, Black’s Law Dictionary 987 (5th ed. 1979) ; State ex rel. Wise v. Whistler,\\n1977 OK 61, § 8, 562 P.2d 860, 862) (emphasis deleted)). So, the first part of Subsection 18b(A)(3)\\nsimply addresses four different circumstances in which the Attorney General may initiate ot appear\\nin litigation for the State. It does not address who controls litigation involving the State of\\nOklahoma after the Attorney General appears.\\n\\nThat issue is addressed in the second part of 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3), e., the portion after the\\n\\nsemicolon. It says the Attorney General may “take and assume control of the prosecution or\\n\\ndefense of the state’s interest” in litigation “if the Attorney General deems it advisable and to the\\nbest interest of the state.” Id. That text gives the Attorney General discretion to make litigation\\ndecisions. It nowhere makes the Attorney General’s power subordinate to that of the Governor\\nor anyone else. Although the Governor or either legislative branch may request the Attorney\\nGeneral’s appearance, their authority to do so is set off by a semicolon from the Attorney\\nGeneral’s discretionary power to take and assume control of litigation in which he appears. This\\nblocks any suggestion that the power to request an appearance implicitly dominates the Attorney\\nGeneral’s power to take and assume control. See ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A.\\nGARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 162 (2012) (“[p]eriods and\\nsemicolons insulate words from grammatical implications that would otherwise be created by the\\nwords that precede or follow them”). Therefore, the Governor’s ability to request that the\\nAttorney General enter an appearance in no way means the Governor may overrule the Attorney\\nGeneral’s express statutory mandate to take and assume control of litigation. Under the clear terms\\nof the statute, the Attorney General may assume control of litigation decisions even when his\\ninvolvement occurred after the Governor’s request.\\n\\nAnd the same is true of other statutory provisions referenced by the Governor, which\\nallow the Governor and others to ask the Attorney General to appear in different types of litigation\\nbut say nothing about the Attorney General’s power to take and assume control of litigation. See\\nGov. Br. at 10 (citing 74 O.S. §§ 18b(A)(6) and (10), 18¢e).\\n\\nStraining further afield, the Governor contends Section 18c “makes clear that the Attorney\\nGeneral’s litigation authority does not override the Governot’s.” Gov. Br. at 11. This contention\\nfails because the provision on which the Governor relies, Subsection 18c(A)(4)(a), simply restates\\nthe authority of the Governor to employ legal counsel under Section 6. Neither Subsection\\n\\n18c(A)(4)(a) nor Section 6 says anything about who controls the litigation if the Governor has\\n\\n\\nemployed counsel in a case in which the Attorney General subsequently appears. That separate\\nquestion is controlled by Subsection 18b(A) (3). Nothing in Section 18c even mentions, much less\\nnegates, the Attorney General’s authority to take and assume control of litigation under Subsection\\n18b(A)(3); nor is there anything in Section 6 that does so, see infra at 2~3. Finally, the Governor\\nurges that “[v]arious” Attorney General opinions “recognized the limitations on [the Attorney\\nGeneral’s] authority imposed by Section 18c.” Gov. Br. at 11-12. But none of those opinions even\\nmentions Subsection 18b(A)(3), much less negates its explicit command, and they are therefore\\nirrelevant.’\\n\\nFurthermore, Subsection A(3) of 74 O.S. § 18b 1s not the only instance where the\\nLegislature has made the Governor subordinate to the Attorney General in legal matters.\\nSubsections A(5) and (18) give the Attorney General the power to issue formal written opinions.\\nThese opinions are “binding upon the state official affected by it and it is their duty to follow and\\nnot disregard those opinions.” State ex rel. York v. Turpen, 1984 OK 26, | 5, 681 P.2d 763, 765. The\\nlist of officials required to follow Attorney General Opinions includes the Governor. Keating v.\\nEdmondson, 2001 OK 110, J 4 & n.8, 37 P.3d 882, 885 & n.8. Even outside of litigation, the\\nAttorney General’s interpretation of law must be followed by the Governor. Accordingly, it should\\ncome as no surprise that the Legislature gave the Attorney General express statutory power to\\ncontrol litigation involving the State, even if the Governor disagrees with the Attorney General.\\n\\nTherefore, 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3) resolves the certified question in the Attorney General’s\\n\\nfavor.\\n\\n1 In re Bardsley, 2003 OK AG 9, concluded that a state board could not employ its own counsel because the\\n\\nlegislature, in Section 18c, had prohibited such employment and required the board to be represented by\\nthe Attorney General. In 7 Wells, 2002 OK AG 4, concluded that this legislative prohibition does not apply\\nto the board of a local service district. The Governor erroneously attributes to In re Meachum, 1983 OK AG\\n97, a quotation from In re Shannon, 1983 OK AG 58. Shannon concluded only that a state commission could\\nhire an attorney when a statute other than Section 18c specifically allowed it to do so.\\n\\n4\\n\\nB. State ex rel. Derryberry v. Kerr-McGee Corp. Controls in Resolving the\\nCertified Question.\\n\\nThe Governor argues that the binding precedent of State ex rel. Derryberry v. Kerr-McGee\\nCorp., 1973 OK 132, 516 P.2d 813, is inapplicable here because the Attorney General has not\\nproperly appeared in the DC Gaming Litigation. This is plainly incorrect. Oklahoma law expressly\\npermits the Attorney General to enter an appearance in litigation involving the interests of the\\nState on his or her own initiative. 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3). There is no dispute that the interests of the\\nState are at issue in the DC Gaming Litigation. See Doc. 110 at 1 (admission by the Governor in\\nthe DC Gaming Litigation that the State of Oklahoma is the real party in interest). Regardless,\\nconsistent with 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3), the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Senate both\\nrequested the Attorney General take and assume control of the State’s interest in the DC Gaming\\nLitigation. Docs. 176-1 and 176-2. Therefore, the Attorney General clearly had authority to enter\\nan appearance in the DC Gaming Litigation to protect the interests of the State. Thus, Derryberry\\ncontrols here.\\n\\nThe Governor also claims without authority that Derryberry is inapplicable because he does\\nnot meet the definition of a relator or some other nominal party. Gov. Br. at 12. But Derryberry\\nmakes clear that the Attorney General’s authority to control litigation in which he properly appears\\nexists “whether or not there is a relator or some other nominal party,” 1973 OK 132 at {| 20 (emphasis\\nadded). Even if Derryberry wete limited to cases where there is such a party, there is one here: the\\nGovernor. A relator is simply “{t]he real party in interest in whose name a state or an attorney\\ngeneral brings a lawsuit.” Re/ator, Black’s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024). Here, the Governor 1s\\nnamed as a party in his official capacity. Doc. 26 at §] 15. And “[ijn an official-capacity claim, the\\nrelief sought is only nominally against the official and in fact is against the official’s office and thus\\nthe sovereign itself.” Lewis v. Clarke, 581 U.S. 155, 162 (2017) (citing W2// ». Mich. Dep\\'t. of State\\n\\nPolice, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989); Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 611, 620-22 (1963)). “The real party in\\n| 5\\n\\ninterest is the government entity, not the named official.” Id. (citing Ede/man v. Jordan, 415 USS.\\n651, 663-65 (1974)). Therefore, the Governor clearly falls under the broad definition of a relator\\nor a nominal party, 1.e., the party through which the State has been sued.\\n\\nAccordingly, the mandate in Derryberry that the Attorney General “possesses complete\\ndominion over every litigation in which he properly appears in the interest of the State, whether\\nor not there is a relator or some other nominal party” controls and resolves the certified question\\nin the Attorney General’s favor. Derryberry, 1973 OK 132, | 20, 516 P.2d at 818.\\n\\nC. The Statutory Power to Retain Legal Counsel Does Not Give the Governor\\nPower to Overrule the Attorney General in the DC Gaming Litigation.\\n\\nThe Governor contends that his powet to employ legal counsel in 74 O.S. § 6 to “protect\\nthe interests of the state” means he can overrule the Attorney General in the DC Gaming\\nLitigation. But 74 O.S. § 6 does not say that. It simply provides that the Governor may employ\\nlegal counsel to “protect the interests of the state” and that such counsel “may, under the direction\\nof the Governor, plead” in cases “in which the state is interested or a party.” Id. There 1s no\\nmention of the Attorney General at all in this statute, much less consideration of the result when\\nthe Attorney General properly appears in a case and takes and assumes control of the litigation\\nfor the State. That subject is expressly controlled by a more recently adopted statute, 74 OS. §\\n18b(A)(3), which gives the Attorney General the express power to take and assume control of\\n\\nlitigation. There is no conflict between 74 O.S. §§ 6 and 18b. The Governor is free to retain legal\\n\\n2 The Governor suggests the “fact pattern” of Derryberry “makes [its] language unsurprising,” Gov. Br. at\\n13, but the principles the Court explained in Derryberry are clearly not limited to the facts of that case. See\\nState ex rel. Nesbitt v. Dist. Ct, 1967 OK 228, 9 17, 440 P.2d 700, 707; State ex rel. Cartwright v. Ga.-Pac. Corp.,\\n1982 OK 148, 4 9, 663 P.2d 718, 721; State ex rel. Pruitt v. Steidley, 2015 OK CR 6, 4 16, 349 P.3d 554, 558.\\nThe Governor, relying on a statement by the district court in the DC Gaming Litigation, says that Svtecdley\\nonly deals with the Attorney General’s relationship to a “subservient” official. Gov. Br. at 12. Respectfully,\\nthe district court and the Governor misread Steidley, which clearly said that a district attorney’s role would\\nbe subservient “when the Attorney General enters the case pursuant to Section 18b(A)(3) of Title 74,”\\n2015 OK CR 6, 4 16, 349 P.3d at 558—in other words, what has occurred in the DC Gaming Litigation.\\n\\n6\\n\\ncounsel to “protect the rights or interests of the state in any action or proceeding” under Section\\n6. However, if the Attorney General appears in a case in which the State is a party or is interested,\\nand “deems it advisable and to the best interests of the State,” the Attorney General can take and\\nassume conttol of the State’s interests in the matter under Section 18b(A)(3). Furthermore, even\\nif there were a conflict, the more recently enacted 74 O.S. § 18b controls. See 75 O.S. § 22; Sesow\\nv. Swearingen, 1976 OK 97, | 4, 552 P.2d 705, 706; Duncan v. Okla. Dep\\'t of Corr, 2004 OK 58, {| 6,\\n95 P.3d 1076, 1079 (citing Milton v. Hayes, 1989 OK 12, 770 P.2d 14, 15).\\n\\nRegardless, the Governor fails to articulate how his attempts to force Oklahoma to honor\\ngaming compacts that undisputedly violate Oklahoma law constitutes “protectfing] the rights or\\ninterests of the state.” 74 O.S. § 6. What rights or interests of the State are protected if the State\\nwere forced to honor gaming compacts that violate Oklahoma law—as held by the Attorney\\nGeneral and this Court? How are Oklahoma’s interests protected by expending State funds to\\nretain expensive attorneys in New York and Washington D.C. to argue that Oklahoma law should\\nbe disregarded and ignored because federal bureaucrats failed to timely stop the Governor\\'s\\nmalfeasance? It is no mystery why the Governor does not attempt to articulate what State interest\\nhe is serving in the positions he has taken in the DC Gaming Litigation. There are obviously no\\nState interests supporting such actions.\\n\\nThe Governor tries to pass off his own personal agenda as a State interest by asserting that\\nthis Court’s decisions in Treat v. Stitt, 2020 OK 64, 473 P.3d 43 (‘Treat P’), and Treat v. Stitt, 2021\\nOK 3, 481 P.3d 240 (“Treat IP’), “cannot render invalid a compact that has already taken effect\\nunder federal law,” and by calling the DC Gaming Litigation an effort to “unwind” the compacts.\\nGov. Br. at 3-4. These assertions misconsttue the very decisions on which they rely. As this Court\\nexplained in Treat I: “Any gaming compact to authorize Class HI gaming must be validly entered\\n\\ninto under state law, and it is Oklahoma law that determines whether the compact is consistent\\n\\nwith the IGRA.” 2020 OK 64, { 6, 473 P.3d at 445 (citing Pueblo of Santa Ana v. Kelly, 104 F.3d\\n1546, 1553, 1557 (10th Cir. 1997) and 25 U.S.C. § 2710(d)(8)(C)). This Court decided that issue\\nby holding the Governor did not have “authority to bind the State to the new compacts with the\\nComanche Nation and Otoe-Missouria Tribes.” Jd. at ¥ 3. This Court again so concluded, as to\\ntwo other compacts, in Treat IT. 2021 OK 3, at ff] 11-12, 481 P.3d at 243-44.° Accordingly, this\\nCourt’s rulings in Tat I and Treat II conclusively resolve whether the compacts at issue in the DC\\nGaming Litigation were ever entered into or ate valid today. As the district court explained in the\\nDC Gaming Litigation, “{i]f a compact has not been legally entered into under state law, it is\\n‘invalid’ under IGRA.” Doc. No. 157 at 4 (citing Kickapoo Tribe of Indians v. Babbitt, 827 F. Supp.\\n37, 46 (D.D.C. 1993), rev\\'d on other grounds, 43 F.3d 1491 (D.C. Cir. 1995) and Pueblo of Santa Ana,\\n104 F.3d at 1555, 1559). Because the compacts were not made consistent with IGRA, they have\\nalways been nullities. There is nothing to “unwind.”\\n\\nInstead of identifying any State interests that are protected through disregarding State law\\nin the DC Gaming Litigation, the Governor appears to take the astounding position that essentially\\nwhatever the Governor believes and wants to do is automatically in the “interests of the State.”\\nSee Gov. Br. at 7 (arguing that “the Attorney General (or anyone else other than the Governor)”\\n\\n23>\\n\\nhas no role “in determining ‘the rights or interests of the state”” when the Governor employs\\n\\ncounsel under 74 O.S. § 6). The interests of the State, argues the Governor, ate “as [he] assesses\\n\\n3 In so doing, the Oklahoma Supreme Court confirmed the Attorney General’s opinion that the Governor\\nlacked authority to enter into the compacts. After the Governor submitted the IGRA compacts to the\\nSecretary of the Interior, but before they went into effect by inaction, a former Attorney General issued a\\nformal opinion that “the Governor currently lacks the authority to bind the State to the compacts he\\nrecently negotiated with the Comanche Nation and the Otoe-Missouria Tribe.” In re Treat, 2020 OK AG 8\\nqf] 12-15. As the District Court held in the DC Gaming Litigation, that opinion was “legally binding on all\\nstate officials whom it affects until it is overruled judicially . . . includfing] the Governor of Oklahoma.”\\nDoc. No. 157 at 36 (citing 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(18), York, 1984 OK 26, §] 5, 681 P.2d at 765, and Keating, 2001\\nOK 110, ¥ 4, 37 P.3d at 885 & n.8).\\n\\nthem.” Id. This would, with no textual warrant, invest the Governor with power well beyond\\n\\nmaking litigation decisions. And the Governor’s self-aggrandizing position has no basis in the law.\\n\\nAs Justice Riley explained in a concurrence in Wentz v. Thomas, 1932 OK 636, | 125, 15 P.2d 65,\\n\\n84:\\n\\nit is obvious that the Hamiltonian idea of a centralized form of government by a\\n\\nconcentration of all executive authority in one office, was not the public policy\\n\\nadopted by the people and expressed in Constitution of Oklahoma. To the\\ncontrary, the Constitution of this state embraced the political idea of a plural\\nexecutive department—one consisting of many executive officers who would obey the\\n\\nlaw rather than policy of a man who might happen to occupy the position of Governor.\\n\\n(emphasis added).\\n\\nMore recently, this Court has consistently corrected the Governor’s misplaced sense of\\nultimate superiority—some of which he wishes to subvert to prevail in the DC Gaming Litigation.\\nSee e.g., Treat I; Treat If, Treat LI. The Governor thrice challenged the Legislature’s defining of the\\nscope of his authority and lost. This clearly shows that the Governor\\'s decisions are not\\nunreviewable or entirely within his powers “as he assesses them.” Further, if the Court were to\\naccept the Governor’s misguided belief that he is sole decider of what is in the State’s interests,\\nthen the State of Oklahoma will have no representation in the DC Gaming Litigation, as the\\nattorneys supposedly representing the State as a real party in interest will only protect the\\nGovernor. That would essentially condone the Governor’s violating: (a) Oklahoma law through\\nexecuting illegal gaming compacts, (b) an Attorney General Opinion by failing to withdraw the\\ncompacts during IGRA’s 45-day review period, see supra at n.4, and (c) two orders of this Court by\\ncontinuing to argue that the compacts are enforceable in the DC Gaming Litigation. Such a result\\ncannot be reconciled with the Oklahoma Constitution’s separation of powers, including a division\\n\\nof the executive authority of the State among the Governor, Attorney General and others. OKLA.\\n\\nCONST. att. 6, § 1(A).\\n\\n. y\\nz\\n\\nAccordingly, the Governor has no statutory power pursuant to 74 OS. § 6 to overrule the\\nAttorney General in litigation. And even if the Court made such a finding, it would not be\\napplicable here because the Governor has failed to identify how his actions in the DC Gaming\\nLitigation are protecting the State’s interest as opposed to the Governor’s personal political\\ninterests.\\n\\nD. The Alabama Supteme Court’s Interpretation of Alabama Law Regarding\\n\\nthe Alabama Governot’s and Attorney General’s Powers in Litigation Is Not\\nRelevant to the Certified Question.\\n\\nThe Attorney General preemptively addressed in his brief-in-chief the Governor\\'s\\narguments premised on Riley v. Cornerstone Cmty. Outreach, Inc., 57 So. 3.704, 728-29 (Ala. 2010).\\nRiley has no relevance to the present dispute. But if it did, it supports the Attorney General’s\\nposition. Consider first the different facts of both cases. In Rz/ey, Alabama’s attorney general\\npurportedly failed to enforce Alabama’s gambling laws. Id. at 718. In this case, the Attorney\\nGeneral is seeking to enforce two decisions of this Court, Treat I and Treat I, that the Governor\\nrefuses to obey.\\n\\nThen consider the differences in the law. The Governor seeks to analogize this case to\\nRiley by asserting that “[a]s in Oklahoma, Alabama’s constitution provides that the ‘supreme\\nexecutive power’ of the state ‘shall be vested in a chief magistrate,’ who holds the power to take\\ncare that the laws are faithfully executed.” Gov. Br. at 15 (quoting ALA. CONST. art. 5, §§ 113,\\n120). But whatever that phrase may mean in Alabama’s Constitution, it is not used in Oklahoma’s\\nConstitution to establish an independent source of power. In Oklahoma:\\n\\n‘the Supreme Executive power’ vested in the Governor by section 2, art. 6,\\n\\nConstitution, is in fact just that executive authority not otherwise vested by the\\n\\npreceding section of the Constitution, and . . . is only such specific executive power\\n\\nas is by the Constitution granted to the chief executive or required for the\\n\\nperformance of such duties ‘as may be designated in this Constitution of\\nprescribed by law.’\\n\\n10\\n\\nWentz, 159 OK 124, § 129, 15 P.2d at 84 (quoting OKLA. CONST. art. 6, §§ 1(A), 2)(Riley, J.\\nconcurring specially). The first section of Article 6, 1.e., the section preceding art. 6, § 2, authorizes\\nthe Legislature to “prescribe[] by law” the duties of a// executive officers, including the Governor\\nand the Attorney General. OKLA. CONST. art. 6, § 1(A). The Legislature has done that here by\\nassigning the Attorney General, not the Governor, the role of “chief law officer of the state,” 74\\nO.S. § 18, and giving the Attorney General, not the Governor, the power to take and assume\\ncontrol of litigation, id. § 18b(A)(3). By contrast, in Alabama, its legislature can “prescribe” duties\\nfor all executive branch officials except the governor. Riley, 57 So.3d at 726-27 (quoting ALA.\\nCONST., § 137). Thus, while the Oklahoma Legislature is expressly empowered to enact laws\\nprescribing the duties of the Governor and the Attorney General, the Alabama legislature has no\\nsuch power with respect to the Governor.\\n\\nAccordingly, the Alabama Supreme Court’s interpretation of Alabama law in Rz/ey has no\\nrelevance to this case.\\n\\nE. The Attorney General’s Client Is the State of Oklahoma, Not the Governor.\\nAccordingly, the Governor’s Ethical Arguments Are Unfounded.\\n\\nThe Governor’s continued ethical arguments show that he misunderstands the role of the\\nOklahoma Attorney General. As the chief law officer of the State of Oklahoma, the Attorney\\nGeneral possesses the responsibility of representing the State’s interest in this or any other\\nlitigation. 74 O.S. §§ 18, 18b. For example, any time a plaintiff claims that an Oklahoma statute 1s\\nunconstitutional, the Attorney General must be notified in order to defend the State’s interests.\\n12 O.S. § 1653(C). In litigation, the Attorney General has the power to determine what is\\n“advisable and [in] the best interest of the state,” 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3), including whether to settle,\\ncompromise, or dispose of an action, zd. § 18b(A)(12). This is quite different from the authority\\nof a private attorney, who must leave major litigation decisions in the hands of the client. The\\n\\nreason for this is that the Attorney General represents the State’s interests, not merely the narrow\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\ni ¢ é f 3\\nR ;\\n\\ninterests of a singular state agency or official. Because of this, attorneys general are “not\\nconstrained by the parameters of the traditional attorney-client relationship.” Feeney ».\\nCommonwealth, 373 Mass. 359, 366, 366 N.E.2d 1262, 1266 (1977).\\n\\nAdditionally, the comments to the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct acknowledge\\nthat “the responsibilities of government lawyers may include authority concerning legal matters\\nthat ordinarily reposes in the client in private client-lawyer relationships[,]” which means that “a\\nlawyer for a government agency may have authority on behalf of the government to decide upon\\nsettlement.” 5 O.S. App. 3-A (“RPC”) Scope, n. 18. This authority “is generally vested in the\\nattorney general....” Id. (emphasis added). The Legislature—tecognizing this distinction between\\nthe Attorney General and private attorneys—authorized the Attorney General to determine\\nwhether to settle cases. See 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(12).\\n\\nMoreover, “for purposes of determining the lawyer’s authority and responsibility,\\nprinciples of substantive law external to the[] Rules determine whether a client-lawyer relationship\\nexists.” RPC Scope, n. 17. Similarly, the RPC acknowledge that “[d]efining precisely the identity\\nof the client and prescribing the resulting obligations of such lawyers may be more difficult in the\\ngovernment context and is a matter beyond the scope of these Rules.” RPC 1.13, n.9. Thus, the\\n“duties of lawyers employed by the government . . . may be defined by statutes and regulation.”\\nId. The rules do not limit such authority created by statute. Jd.\\n\\nEven though the Governor and Attorney General disagree about the DC Gaming\\nLitigation, the Legislature explicitly determined that the Attorney General, as chief law officer,\\nmay control the case. 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3). Again, the Legislature provided that “when so appearing\\nin [an action in which the interests of the state are at issue], the Attorney General may, if the\\nAttorney General deems it advisable and to the best interest of the state, take and assume control\\n\\nof the prosecution ot defense of the state’s interest therein.” Jd. This statute contemplates that the\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n> i .\\n: \"\\n\\nAttorney General prevails in any dispute with another executive officer over controlling a lawsuit\\ninvolving State interests. After all, the Attorney General would only ever take and assume control\\nof the prosecution of the State’s interest from another attorney employed by a State entity or\\nofficer when he or she disagreed with the actions of that entity or officer, or of their counsel.\\nAccordingly, a plain reading of 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3) resolves any ethical claim by the Governor.\\nThe Attorney General is vested with the express power to make litigation decisions for the State,\\neven if another State officer, including the Governor, disagrees.\\n\\nF. The Governor’s Fears of an Abuse of the Attorney General’s Litigation\\nPowers Are Unfounded.\\n\\nIn his brief, the Governor cites a lone hypothetical of the pending Swit ». Drummond, No.\\nCV-2024-606 (Okla. Dist. Ct. filed Mar. 7, 2024) to suggest that the Attorney General could abuse\\nhis power to take and assume control of litigation to prevent state officials from challenging\\nattorney general opinions. Gov. Br. at 16. But the Attorney General has not taken any such action\\nin the Sat v. Drummond case. Further, State ex rel. Howard v. Okla. Corp. Comm\\'n, 1980 OK 96, 614\\nP.2d 45, cited by the Governor, would likely prevent such abuse by an attorney general. ‘There,\\nthis Court permitted the Attorney General and in-house counsel for the Corporation Commission\\nto both appear in an original action when the Attorney General issued an opinion finding the\\nstatute at issue in the case was unconstitutional. Id. at 33-35, 37-39. As a result, a party affected\\nby an attorney general opinion is clearly entitled to separate legal counsel to challenge the opinion.\\n\\nMoreover, the Attorney General’s power to take and assume control of litigation 1s\\nstatutory. Consistent with OKLA. CONST. art. 6, § 1(A), the Legislature, which prescribes the law,\\nsee OKLA. CONST. art. 5, §§ 1, 36 “has the power to not only add to [the Attorney General’s powers\\n\\nand duties], but may lessen or limit the common law duties which attached to the office under\\n\\n13\\n\\ncommon law.’* Cartwright, 1982 OK 148, J 6, 663 P.2d at 720. Consequently, an out-of-control\\nattorney general that abused his or her discretion to take and assume control of litigation could be\\nbrought into check through a legislative reallocation of the attorney general’s powers. See Keating,\\n2001 OK 110, § 17, 37 P.3d at 890 (where this Court acknowledged “the Legislature is free to\\namend” a statute addressing executive powers).\\n\\nRegardless, there is always a risk that the final decisionmaker in litigation for the State will\\nabuse such position. This is similarly true if the Governor (especially one that believes whatever\\nhe says is automatically in the best interests of the State) were able to overrule the Attorney General\\nin litigation. That’s why Oklahoma’s Constitution establishes an independent judiciary to keep\\nexecutive officers in check and permits the Legislature to change the allocation of powers among\\nthe State’s executive officers at any time. Accordingly, the Governor’s fears of an abuse of the\\nAttorney General’s litigation powers are unfounded and demonstrate a misunderstanding of the\\nbalance of powers in our government.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFor these reasons, the Attorney General respectfully requests the Court answer the\\ncertified question from the DC Gaming Litigation as follows:\\n\\nThe Attorney General may “take and assume control” of the “defense of the state’s\\n\\ninterest,” 74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3), in the DC Gaming Litigation—in which the Governor of\\n\\nOklahoma is named as a defendant in his official capacity for his role in entering into\\n\\ncertain tribal-gaming contracts on behalf of the State of Oklahoma—and the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral may do so over the objection of the Governor, who 1s vested with “Supreme\\n\\n4 Again, while this quote comes from this Court’s description of the differing views between states over\\nthe powers vested in attorneys general, the remainder of the opinion makes clear that this is the view\\nadopted in Oklahoma.

Kevin Stitt, in his official capacity as the Governor of the State of Oklahoma, hereby\\nmoves this Court for an order setting a briefing schedule pertaining to the question of law\\ncertified by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Governor further\\nrequests that the Court set this case for oral argument on a date after the completion of the\\nbriefing that is convenient for the Court. Counsel for the Governor tried to reach counsel for\\nAttorney General Drummond by phone and email but was unable to obtain his position.\\n\\nIn support of his motion, the Governor states as follows:\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nOn August 7, 2020 the Plaintiffs initiated the underlying lawsuit in the U.S. District\\n\\nCourt for the District of Columbia, naming the Governor as a Defendant. See Docket, Cherokee\\n\\nNation v. U.S. Dept of the Interior, No. 20-cv-2167-TJK (D.D.C. filed Aug. 7, 2020).\\n\\nPursuant to his statutory authority to “employ counsel to protect the rights or interests\\n\\nof the state in any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, which has been, or is about to be\\n\\ncommenced,” 74 O.S. § 6, the Governor retained counsel to represent him in the case. On\\n\\nAugust 31, 2020, the Governor made his first appearance in the federal district court:\\n\\nproceeding by and through his appointed counsel. See [ECF No. 19].\\n\\nJOHN D. HADDEN\\n\\nLe, Widnes een eo * adie) ‘\\n\\n; . 4 pte tan SARE\\nOA SUSE, ceeane aren :.\\na dd . se tenn EN ETI I FE\\n\\nt\\n\\n\\nNearly three years later, on July 25, 2023, Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner\\nDrummond filed a “Notice of Appearance” in which he purported to “enter [his] appearance\\nas counsel in this case for J. Kevin Stitt, in his official capacity as the Governor of the State of\\nOklahoma.” [ECF No. 176 at 4]. In the Notice of Appearance, AG Drummond argued that\\n74 O.S. § 18b(A)(3) gave him the “power to assume and control the State’s defense in this\\ncase,” and superseded the Governor’s authority to proceed with the counsel of his own\\nchoosing. [/d. at 2].\\n\\nOn August 4, 2023, the Governor filed a Motion to Strike or Otherwise Refuse to\\nRecognize Notices of Appearance (Motion to Strike) [ECF No. 178]. The Governor’s motion\\nrefuted AG Drummond’s interpretation of Oklahoma law and explained “[t]hat the Attorney\\nGeneral has no power to seize litigation from the Governor.” [Jd. at 3].\\n\\nAfter briefing concluded on the Governor’s Motion to Strike, but before the district\\ncourt entered a ruling, AG Drummond filed a Motion to Certify Question to the Oklahoma\\nSupreme Court (AG’s Motion to Certify). [See ECF No. 183].\\n\\nThe Governor opposed the AG’s Motion to Certify on the basis that the AG had no\\nstanding to file it, and that in any event, the question whether AG Drummond was entitled to\\nseize control of the federal district court litigation was not a difficult one under Oklahoma law\\nand would not be dispositive of the underlying dispute in the case. [See ECF No. 186]. Without\\ndeciding AG Drummond’s standing to file his Motion to Certify, the district court on its own\\ninitiative entered an order certifying the question to this Court. [See ECF Nos. 190, 195].\\n\\nOn April 8, 2024, the district court entered its Order Certifying Question of Law to the\\nSupreme Court of Oklahoma, which was submitted to this Court’ on April 16, 2024\\n\\n(Certification Order) [ECF No. 195]; see also Order Certifying Question of Law to the\\n\\nSupreme Court of Okla., Cherokee Nation v. U.S. Dept of the Interior, No. 122,108 (Okla.\\nApr. 16, 2024). |\\n\\nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\\n\\nThis Court has the inherent authority to control its docket, which necessarily includes\\nthe discretion to order briefing, set a briefing schedule, and schedule oral argument in any\\nproceeding before the Court. See, e.g., Winters v. City of OKla. City, 1987 OK 63, { 8, 740 P.2d\\n724, 726.\\n\\nThe Rules of this Court provide, in relevant part, that “[u]pon the filing in this Court of\\nan order certifying a question of law to this Court pursuant to 20 O.S. § 1601, et seq., and\\nreceipt of the record from the certifying court, this Court may in its discretion set a briefing\\nschedule.” 12 O.S. ch. 15, app. 1, Okla.Sup.Ct.R. 1.10(f). The Rules of this Court also confirm\\nthe Court’s discretion to allow oral argument. See 12 O.S. ch. 15, app. 1, Okla.Sup.Ct.R. 1.9.\\n\\nThis Court has frequently ordered briefing in certified question proceedings sua sponte\\nor upon request by a party. See, e.g., Order, Hamilton v. Northfield Ins. Co., No. 117,707 (Apr.\\n29, 2019); Order, Foutch v. Turn Key Health, LLC, No. 117,107 (Jul. 5, 2018); Order, Odom v.\\nPenske Truck Leasing Co., No. 116,554 (Nov. 28, 2017); Order, Siloam Springs Hotel, LLC v.\\nCentury Sur. Co., No. 114,872 (Apr. 11, 2016); Order, Cline v. Okla. Coal. for Reprod. Just.,\\nNo. 111,939 (Jul. 16, 2013).\\n\\nThe Governor respectfully submits that additional briefing and an opportunity to be\\nheard at oral argument will materially benefit:the Court in resolving the certified question.\\n\\nFirst, the certified question presented to this Court involves issues of significant public\\nimportance. The underlying dispute arises between two publicly elected executive officials\\n\\nholding offices created by the Oklahoma Constitution. See Certification Order at 1-2; Okla.\\n\\nConst. art. VI, §§ 1-2. And the issue concerns the proper distribution and exercise of executive\\nrights, authority, and privileges under Oklahoma law. See Certification Order at 2-3. Thus, the\\ncertified question presents an issue of obvious public concern, and the Court’s opinion on the\\ncertified question could have significant government-wide impact, now and well into the\\nfuture.\\n\\nAdditionally, the underlying dispute implicates significant professional and ethical\\nconsiderations, including a client’s right to be represented by counsel of choice, direct his or\\nher own defense, and present that defense to the court. [See ECF No. 186 at 4].\\n\\nSecond, the issues presented by the certified question are complex, requiring\\ninterpretation and application of Oklahoma’s Constitution, statutes, and rules of professional\\nconduct. The Governor respectfully submits that additional briefing will benefit the Court as it\\nconsiders these intricate issues.\\n\\nThird, the parties did not have an opportunity to fully brief these issues in the federal\\ndistrict court litigation. The underlying dispute prompting the certified question arose from a\\nMotion to Strike a Notice of Appearance—not a dispositive motion, judgment, or other merits\\nproceeding. The relevant briefing totaled approximately 22 pages, which is a fraction of the\\ntotal pages allowed for merits briefing under this Court’s rules. Compare [ECF Nos. 176, 178,\\n179, 180] with 12 O.S. ch. 15, app. 1, Okla.Sup.Ct.R. 1.11(b). Thus, the Court would materially\\nbenefit from additional briefing and oral argument that is “strictly limited to the question\\ncertified.” 12 O.S. ch. 15, app. 1, Okla.Sup.Ct.R. 1.10(.\\n\\nFinally, granting the relief requested would not materially prejudice any party or result\\n\\nin undue delay.\\n\\n\\nFor the convenience of the Court, the Governor offers the following proposed briefing\\n\\nschedule, subject to ordinary page limits provided by the Rules of the Court:\\n\\n20 days from the filing of the Response Brief\\n\\nAG Drummond has purported to enter an appearance in the underlying federal district\\n\\ncourt litigation, and Governor Stitt seeks relief from that action. Accordingly, the Governor\\nstands in the position of the petitioner in the present dispute. The Governor therefore\\nrespectfully requests the opportunity to be heard first in briefing and at oral argument. Allowing\\nthe Governor to file the opening brief is especially appropriate given that only the Governor—\\nnot the Attorney General—is a party to the underlying federal district court proceeding.\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Governor respectfully requests this Court enter an order\\n\\nsetting a briefing schedule and setting this case for oral argument.\\n\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\n[Pag Elk,\\n\\nJeffrey B.
